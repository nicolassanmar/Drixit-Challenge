# Drixit Challenge frontend

## Description

This is the frontend part of the Drixit Challenge Fullstack solution. It is a React application that allows users to log in and see their user info.

## Requirements

This solution uses node v16.17.0 and npm v8.18.0. It is recommended to use these versions to run the project, but using the latests versions should also work.

## Design decisions

This project was created using vite and React in TypeScript. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) was used because it is a fast and lightweight development server that allows for fast development and hot reloading. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used because it provides a fast way to style components while owning a small footprint, and makes personalization easier than using libraries like MUI or Bootstrap. [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) was used to handle the data fetching and caching. It is a very lightweight library that provides a lot of functionality out of the box.
